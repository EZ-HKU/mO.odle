## mO.odle

mO.odle is an extension that helps you access course pages in Moodle more quickly, including courses that are not displayed on the Moodle homepage.

### Usage

- On the plugin settings page, enter the course code (I will add a more convenient method in the future!). After refreshing, shortcuts to the courses will be displayed. 
- Courses not captured on the homepage will appear as empty, but you can supplement this by manually entering course information and links.

### Notice

- Please refrain from any illegal activities, this extension is *quite fragile*.
- The extension does not collect any user information, as I don't know how to do that.


***Make Moodle great again!***
